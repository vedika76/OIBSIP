                From humble beginnings to guiding India’s space and defense programs, Dr. Kalam proved that dreams, when backed by hard work, can transform into reality. He believed in empowering the youth and often said, “Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action.”

                His legacy continues to inspire us to serve the nation with honesty, creativity, and compassion.
